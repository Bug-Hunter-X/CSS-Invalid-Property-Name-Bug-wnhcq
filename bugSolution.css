The solution involves replacing the invalid property name with a valid one.  For example:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
  /* Corrected:  Using a valid property. */
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This corrected code will now apply the `background-color` style to the `div` element as expected.
