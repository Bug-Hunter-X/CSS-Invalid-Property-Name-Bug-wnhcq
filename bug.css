The following CSS rule attempts to style an element with an invalid or unsupported property name, leading to unexpected behavior or no effect:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
  invalid-property: value;
}
```

This is because `invalid-property` is not a valid CSS property.  Browsers ignore unrecognized properties, resulting in the style not being applied.
